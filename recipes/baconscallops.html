    <h1>Air Fryed Bacon Wrapped Scallops</h1>

    <img src="../img/bacon.jpeg">

    <p>This delicious appetizer is prepared quickly and easily in the air fryer and served with a spicy Sriracha mayo dipping sauce. I use the smaller bay scallops for this. If you are using jumbo scallops it will require a longer cooking time and longer strips of bacon.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Cup Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Sriracha Sauce</li>
        <li>1 Pound Bay Scallops</li>
        <li>1 Pinch Coarse Salt</li>
        <li>1 Pinch Freshly Cracked Black Pepper</li>
        <li>12 SLices Bacon, cut into Thirds</li>
        <li>1 Serving Olive Oil Cooking Spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise and Sriracha sauce together in a small bowl. Refrigerate Sriracha mayo until ready to serve.</li>
        <p><li>Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li> </p>

        <p><li>Spread scallops out onto a plate or cutting board and blot dry with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper. Wrap each scallop with 1/3 slice of bacon and secure with a toothpick.</li></p>

        <p><li>Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place bacon-wrapped scallops in the basket in a single layer; split into 2 batches if necessary.</li></p>

        <p><li>Cook in the air fryer for 7 minutes. Check for doneness; scallops should be opaque and bacon should be crispy. Cook 1 to 2 minutes longer, if necessary, checking every minute. Remove scallops carefully with tongs and place on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil from the bacon. Serve with Sriracha mayo.</li></p>
    </ol>
